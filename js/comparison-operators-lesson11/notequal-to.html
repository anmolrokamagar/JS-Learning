<!-- Comparing 2 !== '2'

    2 (Number)
    '2' (String)
Since one is a number and the other is a string, their types are different, so JavaScript immediately evaluates the expression as true, without attempting type conversion.

Difference from !=:
If you had used != (loose inequality), JavaScript would have converted the string '2' into a number and compared 2 != 2, which would return false.

Example:
js
console.log(2 != '2');  // false (because JS converts '2' to a number)
console.log(2 !== '2'); // true  (because types are different)
Summary:
!== does not perform type conversion.
Since 2 (number) and '2' (string) have different types, 2 !== '2' evaluates to true. -->
