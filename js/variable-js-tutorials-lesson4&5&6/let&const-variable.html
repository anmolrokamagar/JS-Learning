        firstname = "Baba";// here we can see we can overright the value but cannot declate again.
        document.write(firstname);

        //Constant Variable means if we have given the value we cannot change it again.
        const second ="Hello"
        //second ="World" this create issue in liveserver by click right click open the inspect and search in console because const cannot be declare.
